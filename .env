# Default environment variables for docker-compose
# These are in a separate file so that they
# can be overridden by values in the shell.
# For example, to run the `router` with a locally running `director`:
#   docker-compose run -e DIRECTOR_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 router
# See https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#the-env-file

DIRECTOR_URL=http://director:8000
BROKER_URL=redis://broker:6379/0
