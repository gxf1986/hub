		When you open a Stencila component (e.g stencil or sheet), if you don't have the right session running already we'll automatically launch one for you. So you don't need to launch a session unless you want a specific type (or to play around under the hood!). You have <a href="/sessions">{{ sessions|length }} active session/s</a>.
