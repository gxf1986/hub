Stencila is an open source platform for authoring, collaborating on, and sharing data driven documents. This is the repository for the Stencila Hub at [https://stenci.la](https://stenci.la).

## Contributing

We are always keen to get comments and suggestions for ways to improve the Stencila Hub. Chat with us in the [stencila/stencila room](https://gitter.im/stencila/stencila) on Gitter or using the in-app intercom (if you have a user account). 

If you have specific suggestions or have found a bug, please [create an issue](https://github.com/stencila/hub/issues/new). If you have any issue related to security, please send us an email at security@stenci.la, rather than create a Github issue.

Code contributions will be gratefully received! Please send use a pull request.
