# These can be overridden by values in the shell.
# For example, to run the `router` with a locally running `director`:
#   docker-compose run -e DIRECTOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:8000 router
# See https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#the-env-file

# Used by `router` to reverse proxy `director`
DIRECTOR_HOST=director:8000
