This document guides you through user testing scenarios. It contains a list of tasks that you can try to complete when testing Stencila Hub. 
These are just guidelines so feel free to make up your own testing tasks. If you do, it would be great if you could add them here. You can do it
via a pull request on GitHub, [submitting a new issue](https://github.com/stencila/hub/issues/new) or [sending an email](mailto:hello@stenci.la).

If you would like to become our Hub Beta Tester, please [get in touch](mailto:hello@stenci.la). We use a [simple table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TjQlWXNZnPWXFJ2Aj8_awUJgTfWocM_t52ayx3Hwsro/edit#gid=0) to record the results of all user
tests to make it easier for us to track the tests and fix bugs. We will send you a copy of the table where you will be able to record the results of
performing the following tasks:

1. Set up a new account
2. Log in
3. Set up a project
4. Add files in the project
5. Work with account settings
6. Change Personal Account settings
   * change password
   * add another email address
   * change the primary email address
   * remove one of the email addresses
   * attempt to remove the primary email address
   * change the avatar (profile image)
   * connect third party accounts (GitHub, Google, ORCID, Twitter)
   * removing one of the connected third party account(s)

12. Work with an existing project

Future testing:
- Change the username and see how long it takes for the change to propagate
- 
- Sessions:
    * manually configure session for a project and launch it
    * configure session numbers
    * monitor resource usage
