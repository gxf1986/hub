This document guides you through user testing scenarios. It contains a list of tasks that you can try to complete when testing Stencila Hub. 
These are just guidelines so feel free to make up your own testing tasks. If you do, it would be great if you could add them here. You can do it
via a pull request on GitHub, [submitting a new issue](https://github.com/stencila/hub/issues/new) or [sending an email](mailto:hello@stenci.la).

If you would like to become our Hub Beta Tester, please [get in touch](mailto:hello@stenci.la). We use a simple table to record the results of all user
